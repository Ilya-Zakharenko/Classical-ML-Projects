### **Description**

Brick-and-mortar grocery stores are always in a delicate dance with purchasing and sales forecasting. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leaving money on the table and customers fuming.

The problem becomes more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing. Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, knows this all too well. They operate hundreds of supermarkets, with over $200,000$ different products on their shelves.
